# Introduction

I teach Mathematics and Computer Science at Aston University in Birmingham, UK. I like my students to master hard things. It does them good and I love being part of their personal development. Over the last few years the internet has changed the way many on this planet live so I decided they really should understand how the world wide web works and the quickest way to do that was to write a web application.


Writing a web application is quite daunting. You need to understand hyper-text markup language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS), JavaScript, PHP, SQL, web security, server side operations, client side functions and a stack of other bits and pieces. Everything you need can be done in multiple different ways so simply choosing the code stack is pretty daunting.


Then there is the question of how much this is all going to cost. Students are not famous for being rich so I decided the web application has to be written for free and this book is the result.


Write a Web Application for Free is designed to pilot you through the many choices involved in creating a web application. There are several different ways of taking each and every step along the way. I have made certain decisions and have tried to explain the reason for each decision. If any decision does not suit your purposes feel free to change that part to suit yourself.


In some ways developing a web application is like climbing Everest. There is no unique route to the top though there are several preferred routes discovered by those who have gone before. You could do it by yourself or you can do the human thing and benefit from what others have learned. This book relies heavily on the work and generosity of others who have learned and shared techniques that led them to success. I hope their work and this book will help you achive success too.
